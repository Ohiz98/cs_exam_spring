2)  Consider the following interface:

-----------------------------------------------------
public interface Greetings{

  public String FormalHello();
  
  public String CasualHello();
  
}
-----------------------------------------------------

a)  Explain what an interface is.

An interface is defined as a class in which we define only empty methods, the body of the method doesn't contain anything not even empty body. 
When we implement other class from it we define the full body of that empty class in the interface class.


b)  Write a complete class for a language speaker of your choice, like ItalianSpeaker, which fully implements the interface.

public class EnglishSpeaker implements Greetings{

  public String FormalHello(){
    return "Hello my friends!";}
    
  public String CasualHello(){
    return "Hi there. How are you?";}
