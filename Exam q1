1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    
    public class Smartphone extends Technology{
  
      int number;
  
      public Smartphone(String name, int number){
         super(name);
         this.number=number;}
      
         
b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.

An inheritance is a class in which we define only empty methods, and the body of the method doesn't contain anything. 
When you implement another class from it we define the full body of that empty class in the interface class.

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  

public void speak(){
            System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name +. + "My number is " + number +".");}
    

d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?

   This is known as Polymorphism.
